# DIP-000: Structured Binary Data Format

DB3 Network is building the next generation of decentralized and permissionless data network for the next big things Web3 and the open data format will be the first problem to be resolved

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    sbf(Structured Binary Data Format) --> Identity
    sbf --> dp(Delegation Payment)
    sbf --> cf(Compression Friendly)
    sbf --> ctf(Content Format)
```

* Identity will address the crosschain data ownership
* Delegation payment will give the end user a zero gas experience
* Compression friendly will reduce the storage cost on L1 storage chain, eg Arweave
* Content Format will define the data types that db3 network will support

## Identity

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id(Identity) --> Type
    id --> ci(Chain Id)
    id --> Address
```

the identity includes three parts

1. type, there are two types `db3` and `db3_ns` , the `db3` is a user type and the `db3_ns` is a namespace type
2. chain id, this is a unique id of every blockchain and we will use their token as the chain id
3. address, the address in every blockchain

### Identity of User

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    uid(User Identity) --> db3
    uid --> ci(Chain Id)
    uid --> Address
```

an example id of ethereum user is `db3:eth:0xF78c7469939f1f21338E4E58b901EC7D9Aa29679`


### Identity of Namespace

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    nid(Namespace Identity) --> db3_ns
    nid --> ci(Chain Id)
    nid --> Address
```
an example id of namespace
`db3_ns:ar:0xFC89000...E4`
